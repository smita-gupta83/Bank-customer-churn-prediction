    "Banks in the Financial industry are facing huge competitive marketplace and if they are not able to keep the existing customers then they will not only lose brand reputation but will also have a negative impact on its revenues. It is expensive to acquire new customers than retain existing. Lower attrition rates indicate positive customer-bank relationship and higher churning rate might indicate the dissatisfaction in services provided by the bank that leads the customers to cut the ties with it. Customer churn management plays an important role in any organization to increase their long term profits. Any bank should focus on reducing the loyal customers churn rate since the probability of selling any service to an existing and loyal customer is a lot higher than to a new prospective customer.\n",

    "In recent studies conducted by Bain and Company(2018) for UK banking industry, there is risk of 63% of their highly valued customers( in survey of 4000 UK customers) of leaving due to new rules of using open appilcation programming interface that requires banks to disclose their fee and performance data.This will have aggregators with which customers can compare services, transfer or manange transactions with multiple banks on a single platform. Traditional banks, sees that as threat since their is risk that their loyal customers along with new customers may switch to such aggregators and thery by stopping the use of traditional bank services. In this project, the idea is to predict the customer churn rate for a bank that is loyal for more than 3 years through machine learning using a variety of predictive modeling techniques such as classification utilizing Python programming. The dataset has a variable as \"Tenure\" which indicates length of stay of customer which has been considered to indicate the loyal customer in case if it more than 3 years since those customers might be using the traditional bank services for long time but are likely to switch due to new changes. The features will be created for prediction models and based on the performance the best approach will be selected. Such predictive models can help a bank to identify the percentages of loyal customers that are likely to leave so that bank can take preventive actions to reduce the churn by improving their services and maximize the chances that the customer will remain a customer.\n",

    "Imbalance dataset implies the unequal distribution of classes in a dataset.Due to imbalance, the majority class  dominates the minority class thereby machine learning classifiers are more inclined or biased towards majority class in case of prediction.The main goal of balancing classes is to increase the frequency of minority class or reduce the frequency of the majority class. Following are some of the balancing techiques.\n",
    "1. Random Under-Sampling: \n",
    "In this case, the majority class data points are removed randomly.This can help to resolve the storage problems to store large training dataset but in turn can remove the important information.\n",
    "2. Random Over-Sampling: \n",
    "In this case,the number of instances in the minority class are increases by replicating them.This method increases the likelihood of overfitting due to increase in representation of minority class.\n",
    "3. Cluster-Based Over Sampling\n",
    "In this case K-means cluster is applied such all samples have same size.\n",
    "4. Informed Over Sampling , Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique(SMOTE) \n",
    "In this case, synthetic data is formed by taking subset from a minority class.These synthetic instances are added to original dataset.\n",
    "5. Modified synthetic minority oversampling technique (MSMOTE):\n",
    "It is modified SMOTE algorithm. In this case, the samples are classified into three groups - Security/Safe, Border and Latent nose samples which is done by calculating distances between the instances.Here, the datapoint from KNN is selected for security sample and then selects nearest neighbour from border sample and nothing is done on latent noise sample.\n",

    "The logistic regression is a type of statistical regression which is used for predictive analysis where the dependent variable is binary or dichotomous. It is similar to linear regression but the linear model assumes that the probability p is a linear function of the independent variables, while the logistic model assumes that the natural log of the odds p/(1-p) is a linear function of the independent variables.Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function and the predictions of logistic regression are always discrete and can be used for binary, multinomial or ordinal regressions. For example, predicting if a patient “healthy” or “not healthy” or bank customers “will stop” or “not stop” services, can be done using binary logistic regression. In the case of logistic regression, predictors don’t have to be normally distributed. Logistic regression is very efficient to train the model and resistant for overfitting."

    "Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm is a conditional probability model. It is based on Bayes theorem with an assumption that all the features are independent of each other and required small data to train. According to the Bayes theorem, probability of event A is happening can be found, given the probability of event B. In the case of Naive Bayes algorithm, the relationship of the target variable and features can be found on the basis of Bayes Theorem. The classifier is called “naive” since a particular feature doesn’t influence the other feature. It can be quicker than models like logistic regression and highly scalable."

In Random Forest, Age, NumofProducts, Balance, IsActiveMember and Geography_Spain are top 5 features in predicting who exited the bank who had tenure> 3 years.In this case also, Tenure is not an important feature in the predicting banking customer churn.In both cases (LR and RF), Age is top feature, which implies as the age increases, the customer tends to exit the bank.It is advisable that more features related to age such as marital status, education can be added and researched.\n"

    "The project is based on banking customer churn for loyal customers. The objective of the project is to \"predict if a customer that was loyal for more than 3 years, will disassociate with the bank\".Supervised machine learning using Python programming has been used to solve this type of classification problem.The feature engineering was performed by creating Numerical and Categorical features.For categorical features, one-hot encoding is applied to convert the values into binary vector representation.The entire dataset is divided into Training, Validation and Testing sample sets. The baseline prediction models are created using K-nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on performance metric Area Under Curve(AUC), Stochastic Gradient descent has been selected as baseline model with 75.5% score on validation data for further performance improvements. Alpha, a constant that is multiplied by regularization term, is altered for tuning the selected baseline model Stochastic Gradient descent and then alpha = 0.006 is found to be the optimal value on which Validation sample has the maximum AUC score.Using logistic regression and random forest feature importance, the variable Age found to have positive impact on banking customer churn. Tenure doesn't affect prediction which implies the people who are loyal or stayed longer in the bank are unlikely to leave.Hyperparameter tuning is carried on different predicting models to optimize the Validation set performance and Gradient Boosting is picked based on highest optimized validation AUC score as 83.4%. The model is then evaluated that has 86.2% AUC score that catches 75.0% of churn in the Bank with threshold of 0.5."
